Vehicle Class

âœ…âœ… Challenge  # 3: Introduce a Vehicle Class
ðŸ”§ Your Task:
* Create a Vehicle class with:
    * make(str)
    * model(str)
    * year(int)
* Add a vehicle property to the Person class that stores a Vehicle object ( or None by default).
* Update __str__() in Person to include the vehicle if available.

âœ… Example ... in main()
car = Vehicle("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)
jeff = Person("Jeff Miller", age=45, email="jeff@example.com", vehicle=car)
print(jeff)

ðŸ–¨ Expected Output
Jeff Miller(45) < jeff@example.com > â€” drives a 2020 Toyota Camry

ðŸ§  Design Notes:
* Keep Vehicle simple for nowâ€”weâ€™ll expand it later.
* Donâ€™t worry yet about validating the year or adding VINs.
* Allow Person(..., vehicle=None) if they donâ€™t have a vehicle.

ðŸ”¥ Bonus(Optional):
* Add a __str__() method in Vehicle so printing it returns:
  "2020 Toyota Camry"

Ready to give it a try ? 
Create your Vehicle class and update your Person class to accept a vehicle. 
Then show me your updated test output! Iâ€™ll review it when youâ€™re done. ðŸš€
